# Taime — Native App Submission Guide

This document covers the full workflow for generating native iOS and Android builds
and submitting them to the App Store and Google Play.

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Required For | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Node.js 20+ | Both | `node --version` |
| Xcode 15+ | iOS only | macOS required |
| Android Studio | Android | Install Android SDK 34+ |
| JDK 17+ | Android | [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net) |
| Apple Developer account | iOS | https://developer.apple.com |
| Google Play Console account | Android | https://play.google.com/console |

---

## Step 1 — Initial Native Project Setup (macOS Only for iOS)

Run this once on a macOS machine with Xcode and Android Studio installed:

```bash
bash scripts/capacitor-setup.sh
```

This script will:
- Install npm dependencies
- Build the web application
- Run `npx cap add ios` (macOS only) and `npx cap add android`
- Patch `ios/App/App/Info.plist` with required permission strings
- Patch `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` with required permissions

---

## Step 2 — App Icon & Splash Screen

Placeholder assets are located in `resources/`. Replace them with branded versions:

| File | Size | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `resources/icon.png` | 1024×1024 px | App icon (no transparency) |
| `resources/splash.png` | 2732×2732 px | Splash/launch screen |

After placing final assets, run:

```bash
npx @capacitor/assets generate
```

This generates all required icon and splash variants for both platforms.

---

## Step 3 — Set Production URL

The Capacitor config loads the web app from the deployed Replit URL. Make sure the
production deployment is live before building:

```bash
TAIME_PRODUCTION_URL=https://taime.us ./scripts/build-native.sh
```

The build script will:
1. Build the web app (`npm run build`)
2. Run `npx cap sync` to copy assets and update plugins

---

## Step 4 — iOS App Store Submission

### 4a. Configure Bundle ID & Capabilities in Xcode

1. Open Xcode: `npx cap open ios`
2. Select the **App** target → **Signing & Capabilities**
3. Set **Bundle Identifier** to `com.taime.app`
4. Select your Apple Developer Team
5. Click **+ Capability** and add:
   - **Push Notifications**
   - **Background Modes** → enable *Remote notifications* and *Location updates*

### 4b. Configure APNs (Push Notifications)

1. Go to [Apple Developer → Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/)
2. Create an **APNs Authentication Key** (`.p8` file) under **Keys**
3. Note the **Key ID** and **Team ID**
4. In your Taime admin panel (Settings → Push Notifications), enter:
   - APNs Key (paste `.p8` content)
   - APNs Key ID
   - APNs Team ID
   - Bundle ID: `com.taime.app`

### 4c. Archive and Upload

1. In Xcode: **Product → Archive**
2. Once archived: **Distribute App → App Store Connect → Upload**
3. In [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com):
   - Create a new app record (Bundle ID: `com.taime.app`)
   - Fill in metadata, screenshots, description
   - Select the uploaded build and submit for review

### iOS Info.plist Permissions (auto-patched by setup script)

| Key | Reason shown to user |
|-----|----------------------|
| `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` | Clock-in location verification |
| `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` | Background clock-out detection |
| `NSCameraUsageDescription` | Team video updates |
| `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` | Audio in video updates |
| `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` | Attach photos to work documentation |

---

## Step 5 — Google Play Submission

### 5a. Configure FCM (Push Notifications)

1. Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a project
2. Add an **Android app** with package name `com.taime.app`
3. Download `google-services.json` and place it at `android/app/google-services.json`
4. In Firebase Console → **Project Settings → Service Accounts**, generate a private key (JSON)
5. In your Taime admin panel (Settings → Push Notifications), enter the FCM service account JSON

### 5b. Configure Signing Keystore

> **SECURITY WARNING — never commit these files to git:**
> - `taime-release.keystore` / `*.keystore` — if lost or leaked, the Play Store listing
>   cannot be transferred to a new key without going through a lengthy Google support process.
> - `android/app/google-services.json` — contains Firebase project credentials.
> - `ios/App/GoogleService-Info.plist` — iOS equivalent of the above.
>
> All three patterns are listed in `.gitignore`. Store them in a password manager or
> secure secrets vault (e.g. 1Password, Bitwarden, or your CI/CD secret store) and
> share them only through encrypted channels.

1. Generate a release keystore (keep this file safe — it cannot be recovered):

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore taime-release.keystore \
  -alias taime -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

2. Open Android Studio: `npx cap open android`
3. **Build → Generate Signed Bundle / APK**
4. Select **Android App Bundle (AAB)**, point to your keystore, and build

### 5c. Upload to Google Play

1. Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. Create a new application (package: `com.taime.app`)
3. Under **Production → Releases**, upload the signed `.aab` file
4. Fill in store listing, screenshots, content rating, pricing
5. Submit for review

### Android Manifest Permissions (auto-patched by setup script)

| Permission | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` | Precise clock-in location check |
| `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` | Fallback location |
| `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` | Background clock-out detection |
| `CAMERA` | Team video updates |
| `RECORD_AUDIO` | Audio in video updates |
| `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` | Attach photos to work docs |
| `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` | Attach videos to work docs |

---

## Ongoing Rebuild Workflow

After any change to the web app, run the native build pipeline before opening
the native IDE or submitting an update:

```bash
TAIME_PRODUCTION_URL=https://taime.us ./scripts/build-native.sh
```

Then increment the build number in Xcode / `android/app/build.gradle` before
archiving/building again.

---

## Pre-commit Security Hook

A pre-commit script at `.husky/pre-commit` blocks any commit that includes the
following secret credential files, regardless of `.gitignore` settings:

| Blocked pattern | Why it's sensitive |
|---|---|
| `*.keystore` | Android release signing key — cannot be replaced on the Play Store without a lengthy Google support process |
| `android/app/google-services.json` | Firebase Android credentials |
| `ios/App/GoogleService-Info.plist` | Firebase iOS credentials |
| `.env`, `.env.<anything>` | Local environment files — typically contain API keys, database URLs, and other runtime secrets |

### Environment files (`.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`, …)

Real environment files must never be committed. They are blocked by both the
`.gitignore` (which excludes `.env` and `.env.*`) and the pre-commit hook
(which refuses to stage anything matching `.env` or `.env.<suffix>`).

Two filenames are explicitly allowed because they should only ever contain
**placeholder** values and serve as documentation for new contributors:

- `.env.example`
- `.env.sample`

Anything else — `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development`, `.env.production`,
`.env.staging`, `.env.test`, etc. — is rejected. Store the real values in:

- The Replit Secrets manager for the live deployment
- A password manager (1Password, Bitwarden) for shared developer credentials
- Your CI/CD provider's secret store for build-time variables

If the hook blocks a file you believe is safe (for example, a new template
file), rename it to `.env.example` / `.env.sample` so its intent is obvious,
or add a narrow allow entry to `ALLOWED_PATTERNS` in `.husky/pre-commit`.

### One-time developer setup (required per machine)

Every developer who clones this repository must activate the hook before their
first commit. Choose **one** of the methods below.

#### Option A — Project install script (recommended)

```bash
bash scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

This installs all project hooks in one shot. It wires up `.husky/pre-commit`
(credential guard) as the primary entry point, which internally chains to
`scripts/hooks/pre-commit` (migration validation), so both checks run on
every commit.

#### Option B — Husky

```bash
npx husky
```

After running this once, git will automatically execute `.husky/pre-commit`
before every local commit. The hook already chains to the migration validation
script, so no extra wiring is needed.

The repo's `package.json` already declares the right `prepare` script, so a
fresh `npm install` will activate the hook automatically:

```json
"scripts": {
  "prepare": "husky"
}
```

> Note: the husky v8 form `husky install` is deprecated and will be removed
> in husky v10. Always use the bare `husky` command on v9+.

#### Option C — Manual git hook symlink (no extra dependency)

```bash
ln -sf ../../.husky/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Husky version policy

`devDependencies.husky` in `package.json` is pinned to a tilde range
(`~9.1.7`), which only accepts patch updates within husky 9.1. **Do not
loosen this pin without an explicit upgrade pass.**

Why the tight pin:

- Husky v10 is expected to remove more legacy behavior — the `husky.sh` shim
  that older hook files source via `. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"`, the
  `HUSKY=0` environment variable, and other v8-era affordances. A silent
  upgrade can break `.husky/pre-commit` for every developer on the team
  (including new clones via `npm install`) without any code change in this
  repo.
- Even within v9, a minor bump (9.2.x, 9.3.x, …) could change hook discovery
  or output formatting in ways that affect the credential guard. Patch-only
  updates are safe; minor/major updates need to be reviewed manually.

When you want to upgrade husky:

1. Read the husky changelog for the target version end-to-end.
2. Verify `.husky/pre-commit` does not source any deprecated shim and that
   `npm run prepare` still uses the bare `husky` command (not
   `husky install`).
3. Bump the pin in `package.json`, regenerate `package-lock.json`, and run
   the full unit test suite plus a manual commit that should be blocked
   (e.g. staging a fake `.env`) and one that should succeed.

### What happens when a blocked file is staged

The commit is aborted and a clear error message is printed, e.g.:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║           COMMIT BLOCKED — SECRET FILE DETECTED             ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  The following sensitive credential file(s) are staged:     ║
║    ✗  android/app/google-services.json                      ║
...
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

To resolve, unstage the file and store it securely instead:

```bash
git reset HEAD android/app/google-services.json
```

Store credential files in a password manager (1Password, Bitwarden) or your
CI/CD secret store and share them only through encrypted channels.

## iOS OAuth Sign-In (ASWebAuthenticationSession)

Clerk's social OAuth (Google, Apple, etc.) previously opened the full Safari browser on iOS, breaking
the session because Safari and WKWebView have separate cookie stores.

The fix uses `@capacitor/browser`, which on iOS is backed by Apple's `ASWebAuthenticationSession`
— a sanctioned in-app OAuth overlay that keeps the user inside the app.

### How it works

1. On native platforms, `Landing.tsx` renders `NativeLanding.tsx` instead of the embedded Clerk
   `<SignIn>` component. The native landing shows "Continue with Google" / "Continue with Apple" buttons.
2. Tapping a button calls `useNativeClerkSignIn`, which initiates the Clerk OAuth flow via
   `signIn.create({ strategy, redirectUrl: 'com.taimetaime://oauth-callback', ... })` to obtain the
   external authorization URL, then opens it with `Browser.open()`.
3. After the user completes OAuth, the provider redirects to `com.taimetaime://oauth-callback`.
   iOS intercepts this via the registered custom URL scheme and re-opens the app.
4. `DeepLinkHandler` (in `App.tsx`) listens for `appUrlOpen` events. When the URL matches the scheme,
   it closes the in-app browser overlay and calls `clerk.handleRedirectCallback()` to establish the
   Clerk session.

### Required setup steps

1. **Clerk Dashboard** — Add `com.taimetaime://oauth-callback` as an allowed OAuth redirect URL in
   your Clerk instance settings (Dashboard → Redirect URLs).
2. **Info.plist** — Register the custom URL scheme so iOS routes the deep link back to the app.
   The `scripts/capacitor-setup.sh` script patches this automatically under `CFBundleURLTypes`.
   After running the setup script on macOS, verify the entry in Xcode:
   - Target → Info → URL Types → `com.taimetaime`
3. **`capacitor.config.ts`** — `ios.scheme: 'com.taimetaime'` is already set.

### Relevant files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `client/src/hooks/useNativeClerkSignIn.ts` | Hook that opens OAuth URLs via `Browser.open()` |
| `client/src/pages/NativeLanding.tsx` | Native-only sign-in screen (Google + Apple buttons) |
| `client/src/pages/Landing.tsx` | Routes to `NativeLanding` on native, `<SignIn>` on web |
| `client/src/App.tsx` — `DeepLinkHandler` | Handles `appUrlOpen`, closes browser, calls Clerk |
| `capacitor.config.ts` | `ios.scheme`, `allowNavigation` |
| `scripts/capacitor-setup.sh` | Auto-patches `CFBundleURLTypes` in `Info.plist` |

## Android OAuth Sign-In (Chrome Custom Tabs)

Clerk's social OAuth (Google, etc.) previously opened the full Chrome browser on Android, breaking
the session because Chrome and the WebView have separate cookie stores.

The fix uses `@capacitor/browser`, which on Android is backed by **Chrome Custom Tabs** —
a sanctioned in-app browser overlay that keeps the user inside the app.

### How it works

1. On native platforms, `Landing.tsx` renders `NativeLanding.tsx` instead of the embedded Clerk
   `<SignIn>` component. The native landing shows "Continue with Google" / "Continue with Apple" buttons.
2. Tapping "Continue with Google" calls `useNativeClerkSignIn`, which initiates the Clerk OAuth flow
   via `signIn.create({ strategy, redirectUrl: 'com.taimetaime://oauth-callback', ... })` to obtain
   the external authorization URL, then opens it with `Browser.open()`.
3. After the user completes OAuth, Google redirects to `com.taimetaime://oauth-callback`.
   Android intercepts this via the registered intent filter and re-opens the app.
4. `DeepLinkHandler` (in `App.tsx`) listens for `appUrlOpen` events. When the URL matches the scheme,
   it closes the Chrome Custom Tab overlay and calls `clerk.handleRedirectCallback()` to establish the
   Clerk session.

### Required setup steps

1. **Clerk Dashboard** — Add `com.taimetaime://oauth-callback` as an allowed OAuth redirect URL in
   your Clerk instance settings (Dashboard → Redirect URLs). This is the same entry needed for iOS.
2. **AndroidManifest.xml** — Register an intent filter on the main activity so Android routes the
   deep link back to the app. The `scripts/capacitor-setup.sh` script patches this automatically.
   After running the setup script, verify the intent filter is present in
   `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <intent-filter>
       <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
       <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
       <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
       <data android:scheme="com.taimetaime" />
   </intent-filter>
   ```
3. **`capacitor.config.ts`** — `android.backgroundColor` is already set. No extra scheme config is
   required for Android (unlike iOS which uses `ios.scheme`); the intent filter handles routing.

### Relevant files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `client/src/hooks/useNativeClerkSignIn.ts` | Hook that opens OAuth URLs via `Browser.open()` (shared iOS + Android) |
| `client/src/pages/NativeLanding.tsx` | Native-only sign-in screen (Google + Apple buttons) |
| `client/src/pages/Landing.tsx` | Routes to `NativeLanding` on native, `<SignIn>` on web |
| `client/src/App.tsx` — `DeepLinkHandler` | Handles `appUrlOpen`, closes browser, calls Clerk (shared iOS + Android) |
| `capacitor.config.ts` | `allowNavigation`, `androidScheme` |
| `scripts/capacitor-setup.sh` | Auto-patches intent filter in `AndroidManifest.xml` |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `cap sync` fails with missing `dist/public` | Run `npm run build` first |
| iOS push notifications not received | Verify APNs key is configured in admin settings |
| Android FCM not working | Ensure `google-services.json` is in `android/app/` and FCM service account is configured |
| Location not working on Android | Check that `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` is granted by user in system settings |
| Capacitor version mismatch | All `@capacitor/*` packages must be on the same major version |
| iOS OAuth opens Safari instead of in-app browser | Verify `com.taimetaime://oauth-callback` is in Clerk Dashboard → Redirect URLs and `CFBundleURLTypes` is in `Info.plist` |
| OAuth callback not received after sign-in | Check that `ios.scheme: 'com.taimetaime'` is in `capacitor.config.ts` and `cap sync ios` was run |
| Android OAuth opens full Chrome instead of Custom Tab | Verify `@capacitor/browser` is installed (`npm ls @capacitor/browser`) and `cap sync android` was run after install |
| Android OAuth callback not received | Check that the `com.taimetaime` intent filter is in `AndroidManifest.xml` (run `scripts/capacitor-setup.sh` to auto-patch) and `com.taimetaime://oauth-callback` is in Clerk Dashboard → Redirect URLs |
